# DSC_IEA
Interactive Educational Applet for the Florida State University Department of Scientific Computing courses. Inspired by the interactive educational modules developed for Michael Heath's scientific computing textbook.

# Notes
This applet uses `graphviz` and `pydot`, both of which can be installed via `pip install gaphviz pydot` or `conda install -c anaconda graphviz pydot`. However, one will need to ultimately use `conda` if using Windows, as the `python-graphviz` package is also required for the Recrusive FFTs submodule to work correctly for the Applied Computational Science II course. This is the simplest method for dealing with this issue on Windows 8, at least. Will investigate this more in-depth as time permits. Using Anaconda is preferred, anyways.
